        <p>
            My name is Jennifer Streger and I have decided to create my own personal webpage to show off the new skills that I am learning. <br>
            <br>
            Right now, I feel like that little girl, filled with excitement to start learning about web development. Oh and I also have that wide eyed expression as I have gone out and seen just how much there is to learn about web development and how much knowledge I am just itching to gain. But hey, I have to start somewhere and I am SO excited to learn and showcase my skills! The more I have researched and started picking up skills, the more I want to dive into learning MORE and MORE. If only there was more time in the day. <br>
            <br>
            The goal is for this webpage to turn into something more developed and pleasing to the eye in the long run and to document the progress that I make. <br>
            <br>
            You can check out the fun projects that I am working with by going to my GitHub profile! See the link on the left.
