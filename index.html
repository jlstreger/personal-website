            My name is Jennifer Streger and I have decided to create my own personal webpage to experiment with the skills I am currently working on to get into web development. The goal is for this webpage to turn into something more useful in the long run and to document the progress that I make. I have been enjoying learning, but I am itching to put the skills I am learning to practice. Right now I am quite the rookie but this page will serve as a place for me to play and display the progress I have made. I will also include my GitHub profile link where I will be continually committing my projects that I work on along this journey to learn how to become a web developer!
