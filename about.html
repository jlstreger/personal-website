			<p> Hello again, my name is Jennifer Streger and I am happy to share a bit about me!
			I am a recent graduate from Texas A&M, whoop! And also recently married to the love of my life, Nathan Streger. This past year has been filled with change, happiness, and growth as I have begun my journey after college.
			</p>
			<p>After graduation, I was blessed to receive a job offer to teach AP Calculus BC and AP Statistics at a magnet program for talented students in Science, Mathematics, and Technology. I have enjoyed sharing my knowledge and love for mathematics with the students this year! Being a teacher has taught me so much about myself, and my goals in life. </p>
			<p>That is why I have decided to change careers and work towards becoming a web developer. I find great joy from creating and working on challenging problems. During this past year, my students have come to me with their research to ask me questions. This has excited me and urged me to also go out and learn, research, and create on my own. </p>
